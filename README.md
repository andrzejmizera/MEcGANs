# Cloud Removal from Satellite Imagery using Multispectral Edge-filtered Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains the code, models, datasets, and results of the manuscript titled "Cloud Removal from Satellite Imagery using Multispectral Edge-filtered Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" submitted to the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters journal.

# Code

The MEcGANs folder contains the implementation of our method. It extends the original McGANs method introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04835">K. Enomoto et. al. Filmy Cloud Removal on Satellite Imagery with Multispectral Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets. In Proc. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 1533-1541, 2017.</a>

The McGANs folder provides the implementation of the original McGANs method, where the generation of clouded images has been modified to comply with the method employed in MEcGANs. The original code of McGANs can be found <a href="https://github.com/enomotokenji/mcgan-cvprw2017-chainer">here</a>.
